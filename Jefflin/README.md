# Book Review : The Power of Your Subconcious Mind
***

#### _In a nutshell: By understanding how the subconscious mind works, you can learn how dreams become reality._
\
The Book __The Power of Your Subconcious Mind__ is written by Dr. Joseph Murphy. He believed he had found secrets concerning the subconscious that were beyond time and culture.
---
### How the subconscious works
\
Murphy saw the subconscious mind as a dark room in which we develop images that are to be lived out in real life. While the conscious mind sees an event, takes a picture of it and remembers it, the subconscious mind works backwards, ‘seeing’ something before it happens.
---
### Belief

Murphy quoted : 
>‘The law of your mind is the law of belief itself’

\
According to him, belief helps in shaping our mind. Whatever you give your subconscious, it will register as fact.
---
### Health and prosperity

In the rituals of ancient times, it was the power of suggestion and acceptance in the subconscious mind that healed. Miracles of healing, Murphy said, are simply the body obeying the subconscious mind’s knowledge of ‘perfect health’ when the questioning nature of the normal conscious mind is silenced. 
\
The ‘feeling of wealth’, Murphy said, produces wealth in reality. He shows how to signal to the subconscious so the abundant images manifest themselves in real life.

### Conclusion
\
Many people say their lives were not the same after reading this book. The subconscious is powerful and what you get from Murphy is the realisation that unless you try to understand the non-rational mind, your rational desires and plans will be forever sabotaged.
